# Elite Look Swap

Ability to change 1 elite's color and crown into another's.

## but why?
[EliteVariety](https://thunderstore.io/package/prodzpod/RealerEliteVariety/) by TheMysticSword is a 2-ish year old elite mod that was discontinued before SotV's release. then later she released [RisingTides](https://thunderstore.io/package/prodzpod/RealerRisingTides/), another elite mod with a lot of ideas from EliteVariety carried over and tweaked. ...then soon later i made [Nemesis RisingTides](https://thunderstore.io/package/prodzpod/Nemesis_Rising_Tides/), a further mechanical tweak from the second mod...

anyways, the mod was born from the idea of "what if i put Ironclad's elite skin on Buffered elites and have 1 elite with good graphic and decent design" (which is reflected in the config defaults)

but really you can override anything you want as long as the mod support it (there may be incompats as this is a hack, but mystics mods and vanilla should work 100%)
